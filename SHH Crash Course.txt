SHH CRASH COURSE (https://youtu.be/hQWRp-FdTpc)

Secure Shell
communication protocol (like http, https, ftp)
do anything through terminal on remote computer
traffic is encrypted

SSH is the client
SSHD is the server = open SSH Daemon

authentication
-password >ssh brad@192.168.1.29
-public/private key pair
-host based, not doing that atm

generating keys
>ssh-keygen
private key in your home folder ~/.shh/id_rsa
public key in your home foder too, but need to put on your server rsa.pub

installing a web server (apache) with ssh

generating ssh keys for the local server
initially used a password to log in
gist commands to transfer the desktop public key to the server
now can log in without a password

copy file from local machine to the server
touch test.txt
scp ~/test.txt brad@192.168.1.29:~1
secure file copy, move from home directory, file name, move it to server brad, put it to home folder

----------------------------------

set up digital ocean droplet

generate keys on desktop
add the public key to digital ocean

shh into it with
shh root @IP-OF-DROPLET

he had to add the key manually on desktop for some reason

 when logged in
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt upgrade

 create a new user, you should never use root user
 give it sudo privileges so they can run as root
 also disable root login

 adduser mazman
 id mazman
 usermod -aG sudo mazman
 id mazman

 exit

 ssh mazman@IP
 permission denied (publickey)
 we only added publickey for root
 every user needs public key in their ssh folder

 adding a ssh key as root
 login as root
 cd /home/mazman
 mkdir .ssh
 cd .ssh
 touch authorized_keys
 (copy the public key from desktop cat .ssh/id_rsa_do.pub)
 sudo nano authorized_keys
 cat authorized_keys

 disable root password login
 sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 (pw: hello)
 PermitRootLogin no
 PasswordAuthentication no
 save
 sudo systemctl reload sshd

 install apache
 sudo apt install apache2 -y
 
GITHUB INTEGRATION

https://github.com/bradtraversy/react_otka_auth

git clone git@github.com:bradtraversy/react_otka_auth.git
permission denied (publickey)
ssh-keygen -t rsa
/home/mazman/.ssh/id_rsa_github
failed: permission denied (.ssh folder is undred root user in root group?)
ls -la
can see that .ssh folder has root root
need to change to mazman mazman
sudo chown -R mazman:mazman /home/mazman (change everything in mazman to be owned by mazman, R is for recursive)
ls -la
ssh keygen -t rsa
/home/mazman/.ssh/id_rsa_github
it works!

cat .ssh/id_rsa_github.pub
paste to github
settings, SSH and GPG keys
git clone git@github.com:bradtraversy/react_otka_auth.git
"Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists."

ssh-add /home/mazman/.ssh/id_rsa_github (the thing he had to do before and I didn't, adding the key manually)
"Could not open a connection to your authentication agent."

eval `ssh-agent -s` (alt gr+7)
identity added!

git clone git@github.com:bradtraversy/react_otka_auth.git
IT WORKS
ls
47:00 that's enough (goes up to 55 minutes)



*************************************
attempted to replace the default index.html file in Droplet1 with a different index.html file
was able to delete it
then
scp ~/Desktop/Droplet1/index.html mazman@104.248.24.80:/var/www/html
gives me "Permission denied"
trying to create index.html with touch returns the same
probably because I'm in root and I'm not root?
trying sudo brings up publickey problems again?
sudo touch works!
... but I can't edit it in nano
I think the solution is to do these things in the user folder and not in root
nvm, sudo nano index.html works
just remember to type sudo and everything is fine
still idk why it gives me the publickey thing with scp
I thought I sorted it this morning?
Also how to make a more complex static website with digitalocean and Apache?
tried again, I can connect and do stuff, but scp still asks for publickey
do I need the publickey of the droplet on my desktop? aa
